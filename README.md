## Notes

⚠️ Pelase change the Serial number in SMBios before

This is still a WIP. 

* USB Bluetooth finally works thanks to `BlueToolFixup.kext`
    * Airdrop works
    * Handoff works
    * Shared Clipboard
    * Trackpad and BT Mouse works
    * Monterey's feature Airplay works - Can mirror iPhone/iPad on the Mac without any app
* CPU information is wrong. The CPU is `Core-i7 8700K`
* USB Mapping needs to change


All of the Kext files are taken from [Dortania's](https://dortania.github.io/builds/) website.
